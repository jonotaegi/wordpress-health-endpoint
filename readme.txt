Creates a /health endpoint that returns a 200 OK HTTP status code while WordPress is performing correctly.

== Description ==

This simple plugin creates a `/health` endpoint to let you monitor the status of your WordPress website. The endpoint tests the status of your database connection and returns a `200 OK` HTTP status code while your page is healthy. You can read more on HTTP status codes at the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes).

External tools such as website monitoring services can access the exposed endpoint at regular intervals. This can help you verify that your WordPress website is performing correctly.

You can find more information about the [Health Endpoint Monitoring Pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/health-endpoint-monitoring) at the [Microsoft Azure Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/) website.
